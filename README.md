# Airbnb-Data-Analysis-and-Price-Prediction
###### By Bradley Agwa

## Description
I conducted an analysis of Airbnb data from Seattle and Boston to gain insights into the pricing dynamics of listings in those cities. This information can assist homeowners in making informed decisions when determining the optimal price for their properties on Airbnb. Additionally, I developed machine learning models capable of predicting both the price and score ratings of houses. These models provide an automated approach to evaluate how a particular listing aligns with the pricing and rating patterns observed on the platform.
